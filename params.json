{"name":"Tesseract","tagline":"Easily display and rotate 4 Dimensional Objects in 3D","body":"Tesseract\r\n=========\r\nThe [Tesseract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) project is, not like in the Avengers Movie, about the 4 Dimensional Cube. It should help visualizing the 4th Dimension by displaying the Tesseract as a [Stereographic Projection](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_stereographic_projection_tesseract.PNG).\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Rotation of the Tesseract\r\n- Rotation by pressing Buttons\r\n- Overview of Objects in GUI\r\n- Savefiles\r\n\r\n### Future Features\r\n- Perspective Projection\r\n- Costum Objects\r\n\r\nView of the Objects in tesseract-20131008.jar\r\n![View of the Objects](http://s10.postimg.org/735cti0w9/tesseract_0810_1.png)\r\n\r\nControl Panel in tesseract-20131008.jar\r\n![Control Panel](http://s10.postimg.org/735cti0w9/tesseract_0810_1.png)\r\n\r\n### History\r\nThe Project Idea comes from the Math Club at my [school] (http://egwerther.de/). We talked about the 4th Dimension and wanted to know how it looks when it rotates. Now, after over a year later, the first Versions of the Project are ready.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if someone of you wants to help me, just open Issues, write me messages or fork it.\r\n\r\nStatus: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apricote/tesseract.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apricote/tesseract)\r\n\r\nNightly: [![Dropbox Link](http://s21.postimg.org/42a6d22o3/dropbox.png)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/92tcnmcvq9yjc6u/WFKYf96tWX)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
