Tesseract
=========
The [Tesseract] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) project is, not like in the Avengers Movie, about the 4 Dimensional Cube. It should help visualizing the 4th Dimension by displaying the Tesseract as a [Stereographic Projection] (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_stereographic_projection_tesseract.PNG).

### Features
- Rotation of the Tesseract
- Rotation by pressing Keys
- Overview of Objects in GUI

### Future Features
- Perspective Projection ( #4 )
- Costum Objects ( #6 )
- Savefiles

### History
The Project Idea comes from the Math Club at my [school] (http://egwerther.de/). We talked about the 4th Dimension and wanted to know how it looks when it rotates. Now, after over a year later, the first Versions of the Project are ready.

I would really appreciate it if someone of you wants to help me, just open Issues, write me Messages or Fork it.
